/// @title SeedDance
/// @notice A multiparty commit/reveal scheme designed to generate a shared
/// seed that impacts involved parties directly. For example, generating the
/// seed for a lottery/shuffle mechanic that maps NFT IDs to their metadata.
///
/// SeedDance does NOT implement any access or integrity checks (e.g. to ensure
/// that the correct `TimeBound` is passed to `_reveal`) as it is unopinionated
/// as to how inheriting contracts expose the dance to end users. Therefore it
/// is insecure by default, until the implementing contract carefully defines
/// participants and time bounds.
///
/// Assuming that interactive seed generation is an acceptible UX/workflow, the
/// main problem with commit/reveal schemes such as this is the "last actor"
/// weakness. Whoever is the last party to reveal the secret can see every
/// prior reveal, and knows the outcome of revealing their secret, so has an
/// outsized degree of control over the final result. The last actor can choose
/// if (can simply refuse to reveal) and when (dangerous if able to collude
/// with minter to manipulate results) they reveal.
///
/// Common mitigation strategies involve rewards for revealing and punishments
/// for not revealing. SeedDance makes some assumptions about how the seed is
/// to be generated and used, allowing it to focus on _fairness_ of outcome
/// rather than trying to avoid there being a last actor.
///
/// There WILL always be some last actor in every seed dance, but:
/// - Nobody can predict who the last actor is ahead of time
/// - It is difficult to predict who the last actor will be _during_ the dance
/// - Everyone is equally likely to be in the position of last actor
/// - Everyone chooses for themselves if/when to act, the order is not preset
/// - Anyone who can currently reveal during the dance may randomise all other
///   actor's ability to act
///
/// This is achieved by granting every address a random (up to a maximum)
/// additional duration during which they may reveal their secret. Only the
/// commiter of a secret may reveal it and have the shared secret updated, so
/// we can restrict the time window during which each agent may meaningfully
/// reveal the secret. Of course an agent may reveal a secret in a failed
/// transaction and then everyone will be able to see it, but it won't change
/// the seed. Every time a secret is revealed, it randomises everyone's time
/// windows, thus implicitly changing who MAY be the last actor. This random
/// shuffling MAY remove someone's ability to reveal that they previously had,
/// or grant the ability to reveal to someone who had previously timed out.
/// This mitigates the ability to manipulate the system by trying to be the
/// last actor in the following ways:
/// - The current last actor has only 1/N chance of being the last actor after
///   each reveal
/// - The longer the current last actor waits to reveal, the more likely it is
///   they will lose the ability to reveal at all the next time their window is
///   randomised, as they MAY be randomised to a time in the past
/// - The longer any actor waits to reveal, the more likely they are to be
///   front run on their reveal and have the subsequent shuffle rollback their
///   attempt to reveal (because other agents know their own secret and can see
///   the reveal in the mempool before it exists onchain)
/// - As the reveal times are frequently being shuffled it is much more
///   difficult for an agent to manipulate or censor a single or several blocks
///   as/with a miner/validator to manipulate the overall outcome of the dance
///
/// Note that as the secret is broadcast to the mempool as soon as reveal is
/// called, all other participants MAY front run the reveal in an attempt to
/// grief that reveal. Similarly miners can reorg or exclude any
/// reveal within a single block arbitrarily. While this likely will
/// disadvantage the greifee it will still result in at least one global reseed
/// and the greifer will consume their secret and commitment in the process.
/// Subsequently some other seeder MAY roll the seed again in a way that
/// allows the griefee access to the dance once more, but the griefer will have
/// used their secret and so cannot attack a second time.
///
/// It is entirely that cartels form attempting to reseed the dance in their
/// favour. In this case the best defense is a statistical one, for example an
/// NFT project can engineer their rarities such that a large cartel implies a
/// large sample size, so each reseed becomes increasingly boring as the cartel
/// grows, thus undermining the advantage of having a cartel in the first place.
/// This can work as statistically the chance of achieving an average outcome
/// increases as the number of samples (members of the cartel) increases.
///
/// However, a griefing cartel MAY form with the sole goal to prevent a single
/// or small number of addresses from acheiving a desirable outcome. In this
/// case the attack MAY succeed if the cartel represents a large percentage of
/// the dancers, but it still only requires a single reseed after the cartel
/// performs its actions to completely negate all cartel actions. There is no
/// specific defense against this kind of attack, other than to hope the chaos
/// of the dance thwarts the cartel in the moment. One must ask why a cartel
/// would form (which involves e.g. mass minting/buying NFTs) in the first
/// place merely to perform a DOS style attack on a single wallet. It MAY
/// happen sometime, but we expect it is unlikely to be a common occurance.
///
/// As there are no external or financial incentives required by the system,
/// the dance instead relies on "skin in the game". The addresses that are
/// allowed to commit secrets before the dance should only be those that are
/// DIRECTLY impacted by the outcome of the final seed. For example, in the NFT
/// mint/reveal workflow the dancers should be restricted to those addresses
/// that bought/minted NFT IDs and so are impacted by the metadata assignment.
/// By disallowing unaffected third parties it helps minimise the participation
/// of wallets who simply want to grief some address with no cost (besides gas)
/// to themselves.
///
/// Of course, as with all commit/reveal schemes, the secrets must be commited
/// before the dance starts and the reveal will fail if the secret provided
/// does not match the commitment. This prevents trivial manipulation of the
/// outcome by "revealing" arbitrary secrets designed to benefit the revealer.
///
/// The dance starts when `_start` is called. This is an internal function that
/// will fail if called more than once, but has no access controls by default.
/// There is no explicit end to the dance. The dance is complete when no more
/// agents will reveal their secret. This can only be observed once either all
/// secrets are revealed or all times have expired, but it MAY be effectively
/// true but impossible to measure when all parties are satisfied with the
/// outcome of the dance and so will choose not to reveal.
///
/// There is no requirement that everyone reveals their secrets and the choice
/// of initial seed is almost arbitrary. A block hash or similar can be used
/// as all participants may immediately reseed any initial seed that they are
/// not satisfied with. Even if a miner were to manipulate the starting seed it
/// would be very likely to be hashed into something else that the miner cannot
/// control or predict.
